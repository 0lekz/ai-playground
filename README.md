# AI-Playground

**This is a personal public journey into understanding, reproducing, and building AI systems, one project at a time.**

This repository is a living record of my learning process in artificial intelligence, deep learning, research engineering and similar topics.
Each subfolder represents a step in that journey; from basic neural networks to transformers, large language models, agents and more.

> While this is a personal project, I hope it can also serve as a **roadmap or reference** for anyone who wants to learn AI hands-on, by building, experimenting, and reflecting.

## Philosophy

- **Learn by doing:** every concept is implemented, not just read about.
- **Understand deeply:** code from scratch, analyze, and question every layer.
- **Document openly:** share notes, mistakes, insights, and resources.
- **Grow continuously:** each project tries to build on the previous one, thought not always in order of complexity.

> All projects are added **chronologically**, not by difficulty, I share as I go.
> This reflects how I actually learned, possibly often circling back, sometimes jumping ahead.

## Current Focus (Updated Oct 9, 2025)

I am currently working on:

- Fine-tuning and evaluating **DeBERTa-v3-large** on the MAP competition dataset (Kaggle)
- Understanding **transformer internals** through Karpathy's "GPT from scratch" series and other sources
- Experimenting with **micrograd and makemore** to reinforce fundamentals

## Long-Term Vision

I will try my best to grow this repository into a structured open resource with:
- **Theory:** (some-what)clear explanations and linked research
- **Practice:** reproducible code experiments
- **Transparency:** all resources I've used, plus possibly additional links to explore
- **Reflection (possibly):** honest documentation and additional blogs of how concepts "clicked" for me, not just raw data and resources.
